# DEWR jQuery Slider v1.0.0
A simple jQuery based Slider made by me as my completion of Assignment 3 given by my Lecturer.

## How to Use
1. Load the newest jQuery library on jQuery.com and link it in your HTML file (by CDN or minify, your choice!).
2. You can copy the codes on "dewr-jqslider-plugin.js" to your .js file and modify it by yourself based on your needed.

### Notes:
- I also insert HTML and CSS file as the demo in this package, try it yourself before modify it to your project.
- I already download the jQuery library and put it locally (minify version). Find jquery.js file to use it.
